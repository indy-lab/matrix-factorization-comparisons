# matrix-factorization-comparisons
This repo contains the code accompanying the paper "Recommendations from Sparse Comparison Data: Provably Fast Convergence for Nonconvex Matrix Factorization".

The code is split into two independent folders: one for Figure 1 and another for Figure 2. Each folder has a single .ipynb file which contains the code to generate the figures presented in the paper.
